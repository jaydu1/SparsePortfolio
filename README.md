# High-Dimensional Portfolio Selecton with Cardinality Constraints


This repo contains code for perform proximal gradient descent to solve sample average approximation of expected utility maximization problems with cardinality constraints.
We show that, under mild conditions, the $l_1$-regularized problem is equivalent to the $l_0$-constrained problem.


# Requirements

We use Python 3 for our code.
Please refer to `requirements.txt`, and use `pip` or `conda` to create a virtual environment with required packages installed.
